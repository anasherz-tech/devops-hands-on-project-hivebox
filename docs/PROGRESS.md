# HiveBox – Progress Log

## Phase 1: Kickoff and Preparation

### Methodology
- Using Kanban via GitHub Projects to track work.
- Workflow: every change goes through a feature branch and a Pull Request. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked by a branch ruleset.

### Done
- Forked the HiveBox repository.
- Created a public Kanban board linked to this repository.
- Added a ruleset on `main`: require pull requests, block force pushes, restrict deletions.
